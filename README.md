# TU-Darmstadt-Moodle-Wrapper
Android app to open Moodle links of the TU Darmstadt in the official Moodle app.

## Disclaimer
Neither is this an official project by the TU Darmstadt or Moodle. This is just started by me, a student at the TU Darmstadt, that has too much spare time.

## You can download and install the app for free [here](https://f-droid.org/de/packages/de.jonasbernard.tudarmstadtmoodlewrapper/).

The Moodle at the TU Darmstadt regularly sends me mails with Moodle links to courses, forum posts and other content on Moodle. I always read those
mails on my android phone, but clicking on those links from the mails results in opening the browser. I installed the [official Moodle App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moodle.moodlemobile), and wanted the links to open in the Moodle App.
As this is not nativly supported by the Moodle App, I sat down and coded this little app, that redirects links to the Moodle App.

After the app was finished, I wondered, if someone else could find this useful. The app is minimal and easy to use. Just install it, and all
supported links can be opened in Moodle.

# Prerequisites
You will need to have and android phone with at least Android 6.0 Marshmallow and the [official Moodle App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moodle.moodlemobile) with at least version 2 installed.

# I get a warning from Google Play Protect, what should I do?
I did not upload the app to Google beacause this app is not published to the Google Play Store. Your Android phone may recognize this and warn you.
You can ignore this, it just means the code of the app has not been reviewed by an emlopyee at Google.

If you do not trust me and understand Java and Android development, you can read the code and see what it does. Hint: 
Most of the interesting stuff happens [here](app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) and [here](app/src/main/java/de/jonasbernard/tudarmstadtmoodlewrapper/MainActivity.java).

# Which moodle links are supported?
This app supports the folloing Moodle URLs (https only):
- moodle.tu-darmstadt.de (standard Moodle)
- moodle.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de (computer science Moodle)
- vorkurs.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/moodlevorkurs (Moodle for the mathematicans preliminary course)
- wwwdid.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/moodle (some other probably outdated Moodle installation I found)
- moodle-exam.tu-darmstadt.de (moodle installation for online exams)
- moodle.chor.tu-darmstadt.de (moodle of the TU choir)

If the TU Darmstadt has any other Moodle URLs I should include, [open an issue and let me know](https://github.com/JonasBernard/TU-Darmstadt-Moodle-Wrapper/issues/new).

# How to uninstall the app?
The app won't show up on your home screen. This is intended, as there is no need for a home screen icon.
To uninstall the app, open your System Settings -> Apps -> search for "TU Darmstadt Moodle Wrapper".
