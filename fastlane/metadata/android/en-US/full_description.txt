Open Moodle links of the TU Darmstadt in the official Moodle app.

<h6>Disclaimer</h6>
<p>
Neither is this an officail project by the TU Darmstadt nor by Moodle. This is just started by me, a student at the TU Darmstadt, that has to much spare time.
</p>

<p>
The Moodle at the TU Darmstadt regularly sends me mails with Moodle links to courses, forum posts and other content on Moodle. I always read those
mails on my android phone, but clicking on those links from the mails results in opening the browser. I installed the official Moodle App, and wanted the links to open in the Moodle App.
As this is not nativly supported by the Moodle App, I sat down and coded this little app, that redirects links to the Moodle App.
</p>

<p>
After the app was finished, I wondered, if someone else could find this useful. The app is minimal and easy to use. Just install it, and all
supported links can be opened in Moodle.
</p>

<h6>Prerequisites</h6>
<p>
You will need to have and android phone with at least Android 6.0 Marshmallow and the official Moodle App with at least version 2 installed.
</p>

<h6>Which moodle links are supported?</h6>
This app supports the folloing Moodle URLs (https only):
<ul>
    <li>moodle.tu-darmstadt.de (standard Moodle)</li>
    <li>moodle.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de (computer science Moodle)</li>
    <li>vorkurs.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/moodlevorkurs (Moodle for the mathematicans preliminary course)</li>
    <li>wwwdid.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/moodle (some other probably outdated Moodle installation I found)</li>
    <li>moodle-exam.tu-darmstadt.de (moodle installation for online exams)</li>
    <li>moodle.chor.tu-darmstadt.de (moodle of the TU choir)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the TU Darmstadt has any other Moodle URLs I should include, open an issue and let me know.
</p>

<h6>How to uninstall the app?</h6>
<p>
The app won't show up on your home screen. This is intended, as there is no need for a home screen icon.
To uninstall the app, open your System Settings -> Apps -> search for "TU Darmstadt Moodle Wrapper".
